# Create Release Buildkite Plugin

This is a Buildkite plugin to create a release in [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/). 

**This plugin requires [Octopus CLI](https://octopus.com/downloads/octopuscli) to be installed on the Buildkite agent.**

## Releases in Octopus Deploy

A release is a snapshot of the deployment process and the associated assets (packages, scripts, variables) as they existed when the release was created. The release is given a version number, and you can deploy that release as many times as you need to, even if parts of the deployment process have changed since the release was created (those changes will be included in future releases but not in this version).

When you deploy the release, you are executing the deployment process with all the associated details, as they existed when the release was created.

## Examples

Incorporate the following step in your `pipeline.yml` to create a release in Octopus Deploy:

**NOTE: These examples configure the Octopus server and API Key environment variables in the `pipeline.yml` file, this is NOT recommended and these should be configured as environment variables on the Buildkite agent.**

### Basic examples

**Using version template configured on the project**

```yml
steps:
  - label: Create a release in Octopus Deploy üêô
  - plugins: 
    - OctopusDeploy/create-release#v0.0.1
      api_key: "${MY_OCTOPUS_API_KEY}"
      project: 'HelloWorld'
      server: "${MY_OCTOPUS_SERVER}"
```

**Specifying the release version to use**

```yml
steps:
  - label: Create a release in Octopus Deploy üêô
  - plugins: 
    - OctopusDeploy/create-release#v0.0.1
      api_key: "${MY_OCTOPUS_API_KEY}"
      project: 'HelloWorld'
      release_number: '1.0.3'
      server: "${MY_OCTOPUS_SERVER}"
```

### Version controlled projects

```yml
steps:
  - label: Create a release in Octopus Deploy üêô
  - plugins: 
    - OctopusDeploy/create-release#v0.0.1
      api_key: "${MY_OCTOPUS_API_KEY}"
      git_ref: 'main'
      project: 'HelloWorld'
      release_number: '1.0.3'
      server: "${MY_OCTOPUS_SERVER}"
```

### Specifying Package Version

**Package version to use for all packages**

```yml
steps:
  - label: Create a release in Octopus Deploy üêô
  - plugins: 
    - OctopusDeploy/create-release#v0.0.1
      api_key: "${MY_OCTOPUS_API_KEY}"
      default_package_version: '1.0.1'
      project: 'HelloWorld'
      release_number: '1.0.3'
      server: "${MY_OCTOPUS_SERVER}"
```

**Multiple steps with a single package**

```yml
steps:
  - label: Create a release in Octopus Deploy üêô
  - plugins: 
    - OctopusDeploy/create-release#v0.0.1
      api_key: "${MY_OCTOPUS_API_KEY}"
      packages:
        - 'StepA:1.0.1'
        - 'StepB:1.0.2'
      project: 'HelloWorld'
      release_number: '1.0.3'
      server: "${MY_OCTOPUS_SERVER}"
```

**Step with multiple packages**

```yml
steps:
  - label: Create a release in Octopus Deploy üêô
  - plugins: 
    - OctopusDeploy/create-release#v0.0.1
      api_key: "${MY_OCTOPUS_API_KEY}"
      packages:
        - 'StepA:Acme.Web:1.0.0'
        - 'StepA:Acme.Data:2.0.0'
      project: 'HelloWorld'
      release_number: '1.0.3'
      server: "${MY_OCTOPUS_SERVER}"
```

**Source package version from a folder containing the packages used in a project**

```yml
steps:
  - label: Create a release in Octopus Deploy üêô
  - plugins: 
    - OctopusDeploy/create-release#v0.0.1
      api_key: "${MY_OCTOPUS_API_KEY}"
      packages_folder: 'packages'
      project: 'HelloWorld'
      release_number: '1.0.3'
      server: "${MY_OCTOPUS_SERVER}"
```
